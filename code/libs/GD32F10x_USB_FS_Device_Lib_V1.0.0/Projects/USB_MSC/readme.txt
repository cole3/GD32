 @brief
   This demo is based on the GD32103xx-EVAL board,it provides a description of 
 how to use the USB-FS-Device peripheral.

   It illustrates an implementation of the MSC class which uses the bulk transfer
 while the internal flash is used as storage media.

   This example supports the BOT (bulk only transfer) protocol and all needed SCSI
 (small computer system interface) commands, and is compatible with Windows platform.

   After running the example, the user just has to plug the USB cable into a PC host
 and the device is automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the
 system window and write/read/format operations can be performed as with any other
 removable drive.
